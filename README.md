# plottingmaps
In this repository I'll be posting R code of maps I've been working on, as a means of learning some data visualization in R. I'll mainly post things that I'm interested in.

## plotting2020DemocraticPrimaries.R
The function plots the US map with different colors depending on the winner (candidate with most delegates) of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.
